# ðŸ‘‰ Day 18 Challenge

We are going to build a "Guess the Number" guessing game.

You are going to use a `while` loop and some of the concepts from the past few days.

1. Start by picking a number between 0 and 1,000,000. This will be your first variable.
<details> <summary>ðŸ’¡ Hint </summary> Essentially, what do you want the correct number to be. Create a variable for that number. </details>

2. Create a `while` loop to keep asking the user to guess your number.

3. If they are too low, tell them "too low." If they guess too high tell, them "too high."

You will need to include `if` statements here with logical operators. Include the correct number variable you created at the beginning in these `if` statements.
</details>

4. If the user guesses correctly, tell them they are a winner (maybe add a fun emoji too!)

If they are a winner, they need to get out of the loop. How do you do that?
</details>

5. Count the number of attempts it took for the user to guess number. Make sure you only show that *after* they get the answer correct.

<details> <summary> ðŸ’¡ Hint </summary>

Create a counter *before* the `while` loop and `print` the number of attempts *after* the user is a winner. Don't forget to count attempts using `+=` in the loop.

Extra challenge: If the user types a negative number, exit program.
